# Rover-JAM-Agent-Simulation
Simplified Rover Simulation using JAM Agent and Python for Visualizations (matplotlib)

## Problem Definition

This repo presents a simulation of a simplified rover whose primary goal is to explore the rocks placed in a an two
dimensional grid. The rover has a number of capabilities i.e. moving around the area, analyzing a rock to check if
it has traces of water and taking it back to the base if it does. The problem can be expressed as follows; given a
m×n grid with total area α and r rocks placed in certain coordinates, we need to ensure the rover travels to the
locations where the rocks are, analyzes them and brings them back to base (x0,y0) if they have traces of water w.
The rover is controlled by an Intelligent Agent to direct the movements and actions. This agent was developed using
JAM Intelligent Agent Framework and several tests have been conducted to evaluate it’s performance in different
conditions.
